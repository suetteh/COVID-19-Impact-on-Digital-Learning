# LearnPlatform COVID-19 Impact on Digital Learning
This project is part of the Kaggle datasets. The purpose of the project is to use digital learning data to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on student learning.

Current research shows educational outcomes are far from equitable. The imbalance was exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Thereâ€™s an urgent need to better understand the measure the scope and impact of the pandemic on these inequities.This project focuses on United States, in which we will study:

a) The state of digital learning in 2020.

b) How engagement with digital learning relates to factors like district demographics, broadband access, and socioeconomic status.

### Data Source
Three datasets will be analayzed, namely the district, product, and engagement datasets. The datasets can be accessed from the [Kaggle website](https://www.kaggle.com/c/learnplatform-covid19-impact-on-digital-learning/data).

a) District dataset includes information about the characteristics of school districts, including data from National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), The Federal Communications Comission (FCC), and Edunomics Lab.

b) Product dataset includes information about the characteristics of the top 372 products with most users in 2020.

c) Engagement data are based on LearnPlatform's (https://learnplatform.com/) Student Chrome Extension.LearnPlatform was launched in 2014, it is an online platform that build and deliver digital learning products for students.The extension collects page load events of over 10K education technology products in our product library, including websites, apps, web apps, software programs, extensions, ebooks, hardwares, and services used in educational institutions.

### Library
Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn and Matplotlib 

### Observations:
a) Students tend to access education technology products more intensely between September to December 2020, but less frequently during holidays (summer break, Thanksgiving and Christmas).

b) Top 10 products are of Google's product which Google Docs as the first product being accessed most frequently. Excluding Google product, Canvas is the first product. Products for PreK-12, Higher Ed and Corporate sectors and Learning & Curriculum purpose were being accessed most frequently.

c) Excluding the missing information, Conneticut has the most page-load count as well as suburb area. School districts with 0-20% black/hispanic, 0-20% students with lunch subsidy and USD8000-10000 per-pupil total expenditure tend to have higher page-load count. However, with the large amount of missing values, there may be a shift in outcome.

d) Before the outbreak of COVID-19, students seem to have been using online learning technology but the COVID-19 pandemic did increase the usage frequency of these products. Google is at the first place in providing various products to satisfy the need of students. School districts with low percentage (0-20%) of black/hispanic tend to access digital learning products more. However, due to the amount of missing values, it is hard to conclude if students percentage with lunch subsidy and per-pupil total expenditure have any influence on the engagement index.

### Conclusion:

The following main questions were analyzed: Does COVID-19 have an impact on student learning? What was the state of digital learning in 2020 and how engagement with digital learning relates to factors like district demographics, broadband access, and socioeconomic status?

Before the outbreak of COVID-19, students seem to have been using online learning technology but the COVID-19 pandemic did increase the usage frequency of these products. Google is at the first place in providing various products to satisfy the need of students. School districts with low percentage (0-20%) of black/hispanic tend to access digital learning products more. However, due to the amount of missing values, it is hard to conclude if students percentage with lunch subsidy and per-pupil total expenditure have any influence on the engagement index.

More information should be collected for further analysis especially on variables related to socioeconomic of each school district.
